WHO AM I
===
This is the homepage of Wang Haoran(CrisWang), a senior undergraduate student from [Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn), major in **Robotics Engineering** and interest in industry design.

My research interest includes **on-site application robots** and **exoskeleton robots**.

My Curriculum Vita: [here](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

My research experience and publication are integrated [here]().

And [here]() records some extracurricular activities and the real me.
