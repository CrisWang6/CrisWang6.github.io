Projects
===
**1. A Parallel Five-Bar SCARA Robot with Suction Cup Manipulator**
---
***Project Member***

•	Redesign the five-bar parallel robot, integrate the suction cup to the end effector as the manipulator, and then control the end effector to accurately move objects.

•	Make a video to demonstrate the performance and working principle of the SCARA robot we design.
